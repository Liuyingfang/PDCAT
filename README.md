# PDCAT is a robust test dividing the multiple true coefficients after projection into two categories based on directions of their standardized forms
# This R code computes the p-value of PDCAT   
# Firstly, get the true coefficients after projection in these functions pst and pst_dis
# Secondly, get two test statistics by the direction of multiple coefficients in this dst
# Thirdly, get the paraments of empirical distribution in this chi_paraments
# Finally, combine these p-values of all test statistics in these PTstat and PDCAT
